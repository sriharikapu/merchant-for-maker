Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)
Merchant is a point of sales system that enables small business to accept xDai, BuffyDai, and any other currency. Users simply create a menu of sellable goods and Merchant will automatically generate QR codes for complex orders. Want to buy a double bufficorn latte with two pumps of vanilla and three shots of espresso? No problem, Merchant has you covered!

All Bounties Completed/Incorporated
MakerDAO Bounty #1: Improve the burner wallet!

Note: While this project is more of an extension to the burner wallet, we asked MakerDAO directly and were told it would qualify for consideration of this bounty.
